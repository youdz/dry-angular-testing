# DRY Angular testing

This project showcases the use of a test context, passed through Jasmine's user context,
to avoid code duplication and centralizes the use of Angular's testing utilities.
For more information on how this works, check out 
[this blog post](https://medium.com/claritydesignsystem/angular-testing-made-easy-4e11f6044129)
(the actual code has slightly evolved since then, but the explanation is still valid).

## Angular CLI use

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.1.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
